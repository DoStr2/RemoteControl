# RemoteControl
This Python-based application allows remote control of a PC over a local network. The system uses a client-server architecture to execute basic commands on the target machine, such as shutting it down, taking screenshots, moving the mouse, or running scripts.

Note: At this stage, the program only supports communication within the same local network (LAN). Remote access over the internet is not yet implemented.
